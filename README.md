# Rails Template for Lazy Bastards #

The problem we have is that we are pretty lazy to do the same thing over and over. To put it simple, we are lazy bastards. The purpose of this template is to help you scaffold some repeated jobs for starting Rails Project.


<strong>This is an experimental generator done within one or two days of work; thus don't curse me if it doesn't work in the way you expected. Also, at this stage, things are moving fast, and you might see the complete different structure for every night push. Always pull for new release before start generating new project.</strong>

 * For designer, please bear with my design skill. I have to admit that I have zero sense of design. Please help beautify it and make a pull request. If you have no idea where to start, you can send me the screenshot/css/html of your design. 


Enough talk. Let's get started.

First, you might want to clone this project (perhaps, I might build into gem so that you can instal it instead.)

```
mkdir my_directory && cd my_directory
git clone git@github.com:singachea/rails_template.git
rails new myapp -m rails_template/rails32/template.rb
```

Say `y` or `yes` or `[just enter]` along the way for testing purpose. When it's done:

```
cd myapp
rails s
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. You are ready to the next step on your own.


 * There are a lot more modules that I want to include, but I need some feedback of what you need.
